# üßò AIMeditationCoach - Your Personalized AI Meditation Guide üß†

This project provides an interactive AI meditation experience. It leverages a large language model and RAG with a Qdrant database to generate personalized guided meditation scripts based on user input and offers a follow-up coaching session for reflection and support.

## Overview üßê

The core functionality of this project includes:

* **Emotionally Adaptive Meditation Generation:** Takes user input about their emotional state or goals to generate tailored guided meditation scripts.
* **Natural Guidance:** The generated scripts use second-person narration with a calm, supportive tone and incorporate natural pauses for a more immersive experience.
* **Post-Meditation Coaching:** Offers an optional follow-up conversation with an AI coach for reflection, growth, or simply listening.
* **Contextual Awareness:** Maintains a short-term memory of the conversation to provide more relevant and coherent responses during the coaching session.

## Technologies Used üíª

* **Python**
* **Langchain**
    * **QdrantVectorStore**
    * **HuggingFaceEmbeddings**
    * **VertexAI (Gemini)**
    * **Prompt Engineering**
    * **ConversationBufferWindowMemory:** For maintaining context during the coaching session.
